# Jarvis-VA-using-Python-APPARKY


Python is a suitable language for scriptwriters and developers.
This is  a script for Personal Voice Assistant using Python, and we named it Jarvis. 
The query for the assistant is manipulated as per the user’s need.The implemented assistant can open up 
the application (if it’s installed in the system), open Google, Wikipedia and YouTube and many other 
things as per the queries given, or you give by just giving the voice command. 

We process the data as per the need or  add the functionality, depends upon how we code things. 
We are using Google speech recognition API and google text to speech for voice input and output respectively.
